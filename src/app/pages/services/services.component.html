    <div class="content-full" *ngIf="contentFullAstamangala"> Ashtamangala prashne is a form of practice under Vedic astrology, followed widely in Kerala, where usually a Navagraha pooja is performed to seek blessings from the Navagraha. After the pooja, with the arrangement of cowry shells, sandalwood, floral offerings, gold coin etc are placed in the hands of a little child. On the basis of the placement of the gold coin randomly in one of the twelve houses drawn in front of the astrologer, a review or diagnosis is done, which in turn takes some other aspects or omens also into consideration, like a lamp, Tamboola etc for a proper assessment. This software could be useful for the astrologers to get the requisite readings for the said purpose. Shadarooda, the corresponding Yoni, Jantu, Rashi or Nakshatra with respect to the Ashtamangala Number, Panchasootra, Chandrakriya, Chandraavastha, Chandravela Phala, Dinaashtabhaaga, Saptabhaaga, Tamboola graha, Baalaanna Varjya Nakshatra corresponding to the time of arrival of the Astrologer or Daivanjna, Gandanta, Ushnashikha etc, Thrisphuta, Chathusphuta and more than 70 other Sphutas as well as many other calculations for the DevaPrashna have been provided.

    <div class="content-full" *ngIf="contentFullHoroscope">It is believed that a person experiences benefic or malefic virtues according to his deeds during his lifetime. Moreover, the deeds of the present lifespan determine the benefic or malefic experience in our rebirth, be it in the form of any being.
      According to Vedic astrology, it can be clearly predicted whether the deeds performed by an individual were good or bad in his previous lives through one's horoscope. As per this, based on some authentic calculations the predictions are made with respect to one's education, occupation, marriage, marital life, issues of children, health, dealings or any other pros and cons experienced by a person, thereby suggesting some relief measures too. The above said matters depend on the accuracy of the time, date and place of birth of an individual. So, a horoscope prepared on the basis of the above credentials could help a person lead a fruitful life knowing how to deal with matters one experiences and act accordingly. Hence, the horoscope is prepared very carefully on the basis of aspects like Samvatsara, Solar or lunar months, Nithyapanchanga, Grahasputa, Shadbala, Saptavarga, Ashtakavarga, Bindushodhane, Rashmibala, Kaalachakra dasha, Bhava shashtyamsha, details of Dashasandhi, Balarishta at the time of birth, Sadyorishta, Nakshatra sookshma phala, details of Vamsharishtha if any, Arishtabhanga, details of Bhavashashtyamsha for Bhava Phala, importance of Ashtakavarga phala, Samudayashtaka varga phala etc, which have been taken into consideration.</div>
