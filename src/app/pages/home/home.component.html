  <h1 class="main-content">Indian Astrology("Vedanga Jyotisha")</h1>
  <p>
    Vedanga Jyotisha is one of the earliest known Indian texts on astronomy or astrology. 
    ‘Jyotisha’ is one among the six entities of Vedas or is termed as Vedanga, along with
     ‘Shiksha’, ‘Vyakarana’, ‘Chanda’, ‘Nirukta’ and ‘Kalpa’. Soorya, Brahma, Vyasa and
      18 other eminent personalities of the forgone era have been the proponents of 
      ‘Jyotisha’. It comprises of six parts, namely the ‘Jataka’, ‘Gola’, ‘Nimitta’, 
      ‘Prashna’, ‘Muhurtha’ and ‘Ganita’. Among these, ‘Jataka’ furnishes the benefice 
      or malefic results based on the planetary positions, ‘Gola’ renders information 
      with respect to the celestial bodies or astronomical objects, ‘Nimitta’ provides 
      an insight to omens and its consequences, ‘Muhurtha’ signifies the auspiciousness 
      of a particular time for any ritual, ‘Prashna’ helps to find solutions to various 
      apprehensions or doubts whereas ‘Ganita’ helps us analyse the strength of the planets.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the ancient beliefs or Shastras, every living being experiences a life, 
    which may be good or bad, based on one’s own ‘Karma’. But, one can know the malefic 
    or benefice aspects of one’s life due to the influence of the past lives from the 
    planetary positions at the time of his or her birth, as well as the effects after 
    the birth, could be predicted as per the ‘Karma’ from the Prashna Shastra. It is also
     believed that one would experience the best and the worst during the given life 
     itself. Hence, Jyotisha Shastra is a medium to know about such factors quite 
     exhaustively. But, as a word of caution one has to keep in mind that nothing in this
      world is foolproof and we too hereby clearly state that, as any other discipline 
      like medicine or law, astrology too, might have its own limitations.

      <div class="content-full">Shraddha is a ritual performed by the heirs in honour of the dead on the day of death as per the lunar or the solar calendar. It is obligatory on part of the successor to perform such rite every year since it implies his dedication towards his elders or ancestors. According to the Smrithi Granthas, it is believed that if anyone abstains from performing such duties, he or she may suffer in his or her life with issues related to their progeny, epilepsy, mental illness and so on, which could adversely affect the quality of their life as well. Hence, Shraddha is believed to be a very important ritual or to say Karma to be performed in the lifetime of an individual.</div>
