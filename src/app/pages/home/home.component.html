  <p>
      Indian Astrology ("Jyothisha shastra") comprises of thee parts - "Siddanth",
      "Samhita", "Hora". Among these, Hora conveys the attributes of the Jataka.
      Using this one can analyse future of an individual. The Hora is further
      divided into - "Samhithe", "Muhurtha", "Jathaka" and "Prashna".Vedanga
      Jyothisha The nature around us is so strange that many aspects can only be
      felt or their presence is not visible to the naked eye. The tides have a
      direct relation to the movement of moon. Similarly the presence of sun. For
      eg: a person born during a low lunar influence is susceptible to mental
      disorders. Modern science is very competitive or has answer to many aspects
      but still there's a lot to wonder. The Vedanga Jyothisha is highly capable
      in knowing about the planetary position , eclipse, the sun rise and sun set
      etc. Since ancient times, Vedas have been used to interpret the natural
      aspects which have been along to the human senses.That's why it's said
      अतीन्द्रियार्थविज्ञाने प्रमाणं श्रुतिरेव हि.

  <h1 class="main-content">
      "वेदस्यचक्षुःकिलशास्त्रमेतत् प्रधानताङ्गेषु ततोस्य युक्ता

      अङ्गेर्युतोन्यैरपिपूर्णमूर्तिः चक्षुर्विना कःपुरुषत्वमेति "
    </h1>
  <p>
      Accordingly , it is said, Jyothisha is the eye of Veda. पूर्वकर्मफलं भोक्तुं
      जन्तोर्यदिह जीवनम् means a person is believed to reborn according to his
      wrong doings or good deeds. This science leads a person to solve the problem
      related to Aadhibhouthika, Aadhidaivika and Aadhyathmika and there are
      Devaruna, Pithruruna and Rishiruna too, which are believed to have an effect
      on rebirth and evade the troubles of life. There for a common man is blessed
      with Jyothisha given by renowed sages. According to Vedas, there are
      prescribed measure and their way in order to help an individual seeking his
      desires. So, the timing of any auspicious deeds brought the relevance of
      "Muhurta" through Jyothisha . But of late Jyothisha is being used to know
      the present, past and future.Astrolite Product and Services imbibed all
      these aspects in of Vedanga Jyotisha which havebeen so accurate making its
      highlly competitive in its class. Our research is still on to make it one of
      the novel one. We invite suggestions from people associated to this field to
      make it more efficient.
